# Roaring Times — Development Log

## M0W — Standalone Web Graybox

### Decision

The owner postponed Godot M0 and requested an immediate plain Web gameplay prototype for investor explanation.

### Delivered Scope

- standalone dependency-free HTML/CSS/JavaScript page;
- visible `M0 WEB GRAYBOX — NOT FINAL ART OR BALANCE` status;
- 18 representative irregular plots and eight compressed turns;
- Tycoon, Landlady and Shark rival selection with equal displayed starting value;
- property inspection, purchase and four building choices;
- three action points, one-turn construction delay and operating settlement;
- explicit borrowing, repayment, locked prototype rate and maturity failure;
- four compressed economy phases;
- zoning warnings and a turn-six Residential construction restriction;
- deterministic rival purchase/build action;
- ledger, restart, local save/load and net-worth result;
- compact `1366×768` investor presentation layout.

### Verification Performed

- JavaScript syntax check;
- Markdown and Git whitespace checks;
- local HTTP load;
- all three rivals start with equal displayed net worth;
- purchase deducts cash and one action point once;
- construction deducts cost/action point and activates next turn;
- loan confirmation, deposit, credit reduction and repayment;
- rapid double-click purchase commits once;
- turn settlement and rival action;
- manual save, state change and exact visible restoration;
- full eight-turn result;
- zoning prevents new Factory construction on a Residential plot from turn six;
- `1366×768` visual inspection with map and command deck in the first viewport;
- browser console contains no warning/error after the tested paths.

### Known Prototype Limits

- This code is not reused by the production Godot project.
- Values and AI heuristics are demonstration tuning, not final balance.
- M0W has 18 plots/eight turns rather than the production 64 plots/20 turns.
- Auction is intentionally absent because story/bidder content requires owner approval.
- Debt maturity uses a simplified bankruptcy result and does not implement production asset disposition.
- Map pan/zoom, final art, portraits, audio, production save schema and final accessibility work are not included.
- Save data is local to the current browser/site storage.

### Next Gate

The owner reviews the local M0W page. Godot M0G remains postponed until explicit approval.
